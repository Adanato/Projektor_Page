                We present the first method capable of photorealistically
                reconstructing a non-rigidly deforming scene using photos/videos
                captured casually from mobile phones.

                Our approach augments neural radiance fields (NeRF) by
                optimizing an additional continuous volumetric deformation field
                that warps each observed point into a canonical 5D NeRF. We
                observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to
                local minima, and propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method
                for coordinate-based models that allows for more robust
                optimization. By adapting principles from geometry processing
                and physical simulation to NeRF-like models, we propose an
                elastic regularization of the deformation field that further
                improves robustness.

                We show that <span className="dnerf">Nerfies</span> can turn
                casually captured selfie photos/videos into deformable NeRF
                models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject
                from arbitrary viewpoints, which we dub <i>"nerfies"</i>. We
                evaluate our method by collecting data using a rig with two
                mobile phones that take time-synchronized photos, yielding
                train/validation images of the same pose at different
                viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully reconstructs
                non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with
                high fidelity.
